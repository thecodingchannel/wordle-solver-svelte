# What is this?

In this repository you'll find the full source code for our Wordle solver. The code accompanies our [blog post](https://blog.tiia.rocks/we-built-a-wordle-solver-in-svelte-here-is-how-we-did-it) teaching you how to make your.

# How to get started?

## Software

To edit or just play with this project you'll need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) first. Pick the latest LTS (long term support) version.

## Install

A simple command instructs the Node package mananger to fetch the required libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

Once this is complete you can start a developement server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see the app running!

## Editing Tips

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.
